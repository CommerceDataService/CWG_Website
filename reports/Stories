“We need to stop incarcerating youth as a response. White youth get mental health treatment, counseling, and other supports. Youth of color end up being criminalized.” 
 African American girls to the juvenile justice system increased by 72 percent between 1992 and 2008.

Who : 13 year old panelist 
What : 
When: 
Why:    “As a Black girl in the Bronx,everyone thinks that raping is something that always happens. So if it were to happen to me, it’s like normal”        
Location/City: New York        
            
                    
Who : 
What : 
When: 9 years
Why:    One panelist shared how being sexually abused at the age of nine led her to eventually be involved in the sex trade.  
Location/City:

                    
Who : 
What : 
When: 
Why:    Another noted that because of her childhood abuse she would later experience depression, start drinking and smoking at an early age, and later end up in unhealthy relationships that made her vulnerable to sexual violence. 
Location/City:
                

                
Who : N/A
What : “One day, when I was playing outside by myself, I was sexually abused by a group of neighborhood teenagers. I was 6 years old. I didn’t tell anyone because I was afraid protective services would take me and my brother away.”             
When: 6 years old 
Why: “If you’re a girl, there are certain blocks you don’t take because there are boys over there—you know better. No one ever stops to think maybe these boys are out of control.”

Who : 13 year old panelist 
What : “My brothers were in a place where they were getting beat by their foster father, but that was the same reason we had to leave our father,” she said. “I was furious. I saw how my brothers were changing from sweet and shy to cold and brooding.”         
When: 
Why:    
Location/City:                

                    
Who
What: Another panelist recounted spending nearly two years in foster care starting at age eight while her mother sought treatment for substance abuse. When the panelist was 17 years old, she suspected her mother might be relapsing and told her caseworker with the hopes of getting help for her mom. The response was disappointing.

Who:                     
What: “The caseworker told me to just sit tight and move out when I turned 18,” she said. “How was that supposed to help my mom?”

Who: 
What: African American youth panelist relayed how administrators regularly dismiss her feelings of anxiety, despite her diagnosis of bipolar II disorder. “My English teacher saw me go from an 85 to a 55, but she doesn’t bat an eye,” she said. “She thinks I’m just another stereotypical Black girl working through excuses and expecting everything to be handed to her. ‘Everybody has anxiety,’ she says.”

Who: One 21-year-old panelist 
What: shared her story of how being abused at nine, struggling with her sexual identity, and being kicked out of her home made her susceptible to exploitation.
When:                     
Why: “Survival sex is real,” she said. “Someone I considered a friend recruited me into the sex trade. She presented it as a way to make fast money, but I didn’t know it was ‘exploitation.’” Even after leaving the sex trade, the panelist says she fights the temptation to re-enter— especially in difficult financial times. 
Location/City:
                        
“I wish the systems that are supposed to help us didn’t disproportionately target our communities, so that rather than doing everything to avoid them, people would turn to these systems for support.” 
                
                    


Notes about section:                       
As many as one in four girls will be sexually abused before age 18,13 and as youth panelists shared, such abuse can have long-term emotional effects for victims.  
Advocates also noted with dismay that the justice system views victims of human trafficking as criminals—leaving many who wish to leave the sex trade with criminal records that are difficult to expunge and limit their opportunities for employment, education, and economic stability.

School Quality And Resources 
Who: One 16-year-old panelist who suffers from anxiety and bipolar disorder 
What: She noted the differential treatment she receives compared to Caucasian students.            
“Where is my help?” she asked. “I see so many white girls with mental illnesses get help. Us girls of color with mental diseases sit in the closet waiting for someone to let the light in and say it’s okay not to be okay.”

Who: 
What: One panelist said teachers are often the gatekeepers to extracurricular activities in STEM.                
“The teacher will tell a certain student to stay after class, like ‘I need to talk about your grade,’ and during that conversation tell him about this other opportunity,” the panelist said. Youth panelists said they would take more advantage of STEM activities if given the opportunity to participate. Some even noted that participation in programs could help them thrive in those subjects. According to another youth panelist, stereotypes and an “expectation for girls to just cheer on boys from the sideline” also prevent girls from participating in sports and other physical activities.

Notes: 
                
Limited resources are being used for responses to behavior that contribute to the over-policing of schools. For example, New York City Public Schools employs 5,400 school police officers, but only 3,000 guidance counselors and 1,500 social workers.        
            
Quotes:         
“I’ve tried to get into different programs, but I’ve been told, ‘You’re just a girl, so that’s not for you.’” 
“At our school, STEM programs are one of those hush-hush things.”             
            
        
    

                           
            
                
                    
Barriers To Success In College And Beyond 
                
            
Who: one panelist grew up in kinship care and thought college would be her “escape from poverty and violence-stricken neighborhoods.” However, her college plans were complicated when she aged out of receiving kinship care benefits and the upstate New York university in which she enrolled took family safety nets for granted.    
What : “I had a 3.8 GPA at the end of my freshman year. But at the beginning of my sophomore year, I was diagnosed with epilepsy and began to miss a lot of classes because of uncontrollable and violent seizures,” she said. “The administration kept telling me to take a leave of absence and go home. They had no idea what going home meant to a student like me.” For her, it meant possible homelessness or a return to never-ending poverty and violence. Summer and other extended breaks present similar challenges to students who come from economically unstable communities.         
When
Why    
Location/City:

Who: college student 
What: college can be an isolating experience for students from economically disadvantaged families. Another panelist said she felt “uncomfortable, embarrassed, and lonely” living among more affluent students in the “trust fund baby dorm,” seeing students and parents driving luxury cars, and regularly having to turn down invitations to go into town for dinner or to go to formal functions.

What:One panelist recalled getting calls from younger siblings asking if she could send money home for necessities like rent or food.“It’s not uncommon to graduate, find a job, but with student loans and taking care of your family, you’re lucky to be able to afford rent.”

“Caring for and caring about girls of color has to be directed. Measures for girls generally overlook the specific needs of girls of color, and measures for boys of color ignore or distort the gender differences.” 

Gender Injustice Report

Who: 16-year-old transgender girl of color
What: Connecticut does not have a separate facility for girls under the age of 18. She was placed in a maximum-security facility that houses adult women convicted of the most serious crimes. Due to federal laws mandating the separation of youth and adults, she was first isolated at the facility for adult women then isolated at a secure facility for boys. 
When: 2014
Why: This case demonstrates how the juvenile justice system fails to adopt a developmental approach with social context and prioritizes control over treatment.
Location/City: Connecticut

Highlights

Nationally, girls are most likely to be detained for status offenses, violations that would not be considered crimes if committed by an adult. These include, truancy or running away, technical violations of probation, misdemeanors or other minor offenses.

Many courts cannot integrate data on the same girl. Linking information from multiple cases and addressing a full range of issues can promote effective communication among agencies and create a more holistic approach to helping girls.

Programs that are developmentally-focused and approach girls holistically are more effective and less expensive than incarceration. Alternatives include: 
services that treat each girl individually and engage her family
Short-term shelter beds can be used to triage girls with low-level offences rather than resorting to detention
sending youth to a state training school for committing first-time non-violent offense as an alternative to incarceration
