                <h3>Teach Girls Their Rights</h3>
                Evidence-based research indicates that when girls understand and recognize their right to be be safe, respected and supported, they are more likely to be pro-active in the face of risk and to extricate themselves and advocate for help and resources from others.

                  Communities can recognize that school disengagement can occur because of exposure to trauma or abuse. Disengaged students are at heightened risk for being recruited into commercial sex trafficking. Be aware of the signs and signals of trafficking and advocate for girls to receive the services they need.

                <h3>Reform Disciplinary Policies</h3>
                Replacing harsh, inflexible, zero-tolerance policies with alternative discipline practices. These alternatives include Restorative Justice practices - which allow all parties involved in an incident to determine a solution to stop the inappropriate behavior - or Positive Behavior Intervention and Support strategies that proactively encourage appropriate behavior in the classroom and broader school environment.

           <div class="main-nav-dd-column">
               <h3>Elect Youth Advocates</h3>
               Establishing youth advocates or a designated bias-aware official in school to help resolve conflicts, negotiate appropriate disciplinary actions, and work with students to clear minor infractions from their records. Having such an advocate helps improve transparency and cultivate a sense of fairness among students, and it lowers the risk of a single infraction negatively affecting a student's chance to attend the college of her choice.

                <h3>Know Your Bias</h3>
                Teachers, principals and other school administrators need regular training to help them recognize their implicit biases. Schools need to provide professional development that is ongoing and integrated into the fabric of the school, so teachers and administrators will be able to unpack their racial bias and improve their relationship with students.
