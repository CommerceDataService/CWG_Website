Common Core of Data, Public Elementary/Secondary School Universe Survey, 2013-14

FILE NAME = sc131a_supp.txt, 2013-14

Numer of variables = 324

Number of observations = 102,815

(*) Fields have one explicit decimal place, unless otherwise noted.

(^) Fields have six explicit decimal places

(+) Fields represent subfields of the fields immediately preceding them.

The file contains data for the school year 2013–14 sorted by the NCES assigned school identification code (NCESSCH). Data
presented in this release are available in two formats—SAS datasets (.sas7bdat) and tab-separated values text files (.txt).

Note that starting with the 2002–03 CCD, all numeric fields contain a -1 to indicate missing and a -2 to indicate not applicable.
Previously, numeric fields contained an “M” to indicate missing and an “N” to indicate not applicable.  Character fields continue
to use “M” for missing and “N” for not applicable. “AN” and “N” are alphanumeric and numeric data, respectively.  Starting with 
the 2009-10 2a file, the numeric fields were tested against NCES data quality standards; a -9 value indicates that the data item 
did not meet those standards.

                              left of the decimal point represent the number of degrees from the prime meridian; the digits to the right 
                              of the decimal point represent the fraction of the next degree carried out to six decimal places.

                              to the House of Representative of the United States Congress. The first two digits are the ANSI state numeric 
                              code, which makes the congressional district code unique across states (see Appendix C Glossary for detail).
